Hello, my name is Martin and I'm a software developer and kernel hacker. I like to take things apart to modify/repair/enhance them or just to see how they work.

This github page is a place to write down anything I deem important enough to share it. It could be things I'm currently working on, something I want to understand better by trying to explain it or just random thoughts.

If you want to get in touch, send a mail to **martin (dot) juecker (at) gmail (dot) com**.
